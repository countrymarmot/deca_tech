This is Anuvad, release 0.10.

This package provides C++ libraries and programs for working with GDSII
Stream Format and OASIS.  These are file formats for describing
IC layouts.

It includes C++ classes for
  - reading and writing GDSII and OASIS files
  - conversion between GDSII and an ASCII equivalent
  - conversion between OASIS and an ASCII equivalent
  - conversion from GDSII to OASIS.
It also includes some simple command-line programs to exercise the
code.

Descriptions of GDSII are available on the web at several places;
search for "gdsii stream format".  The OASIS specification is
available from www.semi.org for USD 100.


Website and Mailing List
------------------------

You can get the latest version of Anuvad from
    http://www.softjin.com/html/anuvad.htm
You will have to register first, if you have not already done so.

Note that Anuvad is not open source.  Although the source is available
free of charge, you are allowed to distribute only binaries, not source.

There is a mailing list, anuvad-dev@softjin.com, for those interested in
the package.  To subscribe, send mail to anuvad-dev-request@softjin.com
with the single word
    subscribe
in the body of the message.


Platforms
---------

Of late Anuvad has been tested only on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
with gcc 3.4.x and RHEL 5 with gcc 4.x.  Earlier versions were
tested on these platforms:

  - Red Hat Linux 9 with gcc 3.2.2 and gcc 3.4.1
  - Solaris 8 with gcc 3.2.2
  - Microsoft Windows 2000 (Service Pack 4) with MinGW's gcc 3.4.2
    (http://www.mingw.org)
  - Microsoft Windows XP Professional (Service Pack 2) with MinGW's gcc 3.4.2
    (http://www.mingw.org)
    Other Microsoft Windows platforms supported by MinGW may also build this
    source.  However, this has not been tested.


Building
--------

See src/INSTALL for prerequisites and build instructions.  If you are
impatient and you have a Linux system, try this first:

    cd src; make

If it succeeds you will find the libraries in lib/ and the executables
in bin/.  Each executable prints a brief usage message if it is invoked
without arguments.


Documentation
-------------

There is no formal API documentation, but you should find the source
code easy enough to read.  Each source directory contains a file
Overview that briefly describes the files in the directory and how they
are related.  Read these Overview files, beginning with src/Overview,
before you read the sources.

If you only want to understand how to use the libraries to read and
write GDSII and OASIS files, read gdsii/Tutorial and oasis/Tutorial.


Feedback
--------

Please send questions, comments, bug reports, and requests for
enhancements to anuvad-dev@softjin.com.  For general enquiries, see
